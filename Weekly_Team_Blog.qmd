# Community Capital Documentation
With a view to providing helpful and clear data about capitals and supporting future research in community developments, we developed a clear documentation for the measures.

These are the two final datasets we aggregated:

## Documentation Book
We are aware that you can only make good analysis when you understand the data.

With that in mind,we created a brief documentation book to help our clients fully understand the data.

# ACS Time Series Data Collection
Next, we decided to explore how measures have changed throughout the time.

We collected data for ACS measures from the 5-year Report survey for the years 2012, 2017 and 2022 to avoid overlapping periods.
